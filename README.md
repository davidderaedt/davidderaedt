## A rough timeline of my obsession with making software

### 2020-today

Still a hobby developer, I'm now focusing on building 3D games and VR / AR / XR experiences & tools, using C# and Unity almost exclusively.

### 2017-2020

During these years I stepped away from web development and spent a lot of my personnal time learning Machine Learning with Python and Jupyter notebooks. It was a great experience from a learning point of view, even though I'm afraid I didn't build/release anything special out of it !

### 2012-2017

Now working full time at Adobe, I went back to just being a hobby developer. During these years I mostly coded for fun in javascript - both front end and nodejs - often in the context of developing [plug-ins](https://github.com/davidderaedt/SVG-NOW) and [extensions](https://github.com/davidderaedt/Illustrator-Layer-Exporter) for various Adobe Creative Cloud apps, and other developer tools in the creative coding ecosystem. 

### 2002-2012

I started my career with Flash and ActionScript, as a consultant, teacher and publisher. For all the bad press it got later, Flash started as an incredible creative tool, open to a diverse range of skills and backgrounds, which is probably why the community was so amazing.
