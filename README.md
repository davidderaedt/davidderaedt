## A rough timeline of my obsession with making software

### 2020-

I'm now building 3D games and VR / AR / XR experiences with C# in Unity.

### 2017-2020

Spent a ton of time with Machine Learning with Python and Jupyter notebooks. 
Great experience from a learning point of view but didn't build anything special out of this.

### 2012-2017

Now just a hobby developer, I mostly coded stuff for fun in javascript - front end and nodejs - mostly in the context of developing extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud, and various developer tools for the creative coding ecosystem.

### 2002-2012

I started my career with Flash and ActionScript, as a consultant, teacher and publisher. For all the bad press it got later, Flash started as an incredible creative tool, open to really wide range of skill set, which is probably why the community was so amazing.
