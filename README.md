## A rough timeline of my obsession with making software

### 2020-today

I'm now mostly building 3D games and VR / AR / XR experiences and tools using C# and Unity.

### 2017-2020

I spent a ton of time learning Machine Learning with Python and Jupyter notebooks. It was a great experience from a learning point of view but I'm afraid I didn't build anything special out of this. 

### 2012-2017

Now just a hobby developer, I mostly coded for fun in javascript - both front end and nodejs - mostly in the context of developing extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud, and various developer tools for creatives and the creative coding ecosystem. 

### 2002-2012

I started my career with Flash and ActionScript, as a consultant, teacher and publisher. For all the bad press it got later, Flash started as an incredible creative tool, open to a diverse range of skills and backgrounds, which is probably why the community was so amazing.
